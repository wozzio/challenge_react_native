### App

The idea is to do an trivia app with 4 screens

- Welcome: the user clicks the get started button to start playing
- Questions: the user answer the questions with true of false
- Thanks For Playing: shows all the user score and two buttons one for playing again and one to check the answers
- Check answers: shows all the questions that he missed and the ones that he got rightt

# Requirements

Use React/React Native with styled-components, react-router/react-navigation, axios and any global state management library like Context, Redux or Mobx.

# Nice To Have

Good Folder Organization, Well made UI and UX, Tests, Typescript and also Componentization.

Also if it is made in react native work with the fonts and pixel responsiveness through devices: iPhone X and iPhone SE
